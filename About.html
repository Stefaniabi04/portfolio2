        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I’m Stefaniabigail Lopez, a passionate Backend Engineering with a deep enthusiasm for technology and
            problem-solving. I love building innovative and efficient software solutions that not only solve real-world
            problems but also make the user experience seamless and intuitive. I specialize in both front-end and
            back-end development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,java, wireshark, eclipse , netbeans , and  MySQL.
        </p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My passion for software engineering started from a fascination with how things work behind the scenes. What
            began as simple curiosity quickly transformed into a commitment to mastering the craft. I’ve learned to
            write clean, scalable code, and build responsive, user-friendly applications that deliver great experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve worked on a variety of projects that span from small websites to more complex, full-scale applications.
            These projects have not only sharpened my technical skills but also helped me develop problem-solving
            abilities and work collaboratively in fast-paced environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every new challenge is an opportunity to grow, and I constantly seek to learn new programming languages,
            frameworks, and best practices to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field.
        </p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m passionate about exploring new technology trends and brainstorming creative ways to
            solve everyday challenges. I also love sharing my knowledge with others through mentorship or creating
            educational content. Some of my hobbies include photography, gaming, and blogging, which help me stay
            inspired and find new ideas to incorporate into my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m constantly motivated by the idea that technology can change the world, and I’m committed to using my
            skills to make a meaningful impact. Every line of code I write is a step toward that goal, and I’m excited
            for the future of software engineering.
